# Image classification using VGG16
#### This project was inspired by NVIDIA's Deep Learning Course.

##  For this cenario you are farmer who is herited his father's orchard and keen on modernization. Now the hardest task of yours is to make dinstinction between goods you produce, whether what is rotten and what is an excellent fruit. For this purpose you have to hire seasonal workers who examine the fruits one by one. 

### You have an idea, using conveyor belt, some servos and cameras you can built an automatic fruit selector. However, how would the machine know which category they belong to. We could use semantic AI and mimic human decision making by explicitly writing hardcoded rules. Like the average colors in a rotten fruits are darker. But luckily we have publicly available dataset on these problem. Why not use Deep Learning algoritms to find the needed set of rules on their own? Convolutional neural networks do an excellent task at recognising patterns on a labeled dataset like ours. 

### Following this project you will be able to mofify a common CNN model called VGG16, which is already familiar with fruits, and make it predict good and bad fruit distinctions. Using this technique you will be able to make prediction on a never-before-seen fruit with 0.99 accuracy.
